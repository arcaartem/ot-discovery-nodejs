# CONTRIBUTING

Contributing is welcomed and appreciated.

Open new feature work against `v1-pre` (see [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md) for branch plans).

If you are fixing a critical bug, open the bug fix against `master` - and it should be targeted, limited low-risk fix.

## stylisms

We prefer
```
foo: () ->
```
to
```
foo:()->
```

We prefer
```
a = require 'bah'
badness = require 'cat'
```
to
```
a       = require 'bah'
badness = require 'cat'
```

Other stylistic issues will be caught by the linters.
The code is in flux re: these stylisms right now but will be cleaned up over time.

## testing

Please do not lower test coverage.
Try to reach 100% branch and statement coverage for new feature work.
